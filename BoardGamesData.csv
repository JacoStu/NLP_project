begins by selecting a secret rule and marking the card with the provided clips. always start with easy cards when there are new players. the moderator then creates the first two structures, using one or more pieces for each. one of these structures will follow the secret rule, and the other will not. if a structure follows the rule, it will be marked with a white token, and if not, it will be marked with a black token. players will then take turns, each time building a new structure, finding out if it follows the rule or not, and optionally making a guess at the secret rule. but to make an official guess, players must spend “guessing tokens,” which are earned by correctly predicting whether or not a new structure follows the secret rule.goalthe first player to correctly guess the secret rule wins!2examplesuppose the moderator chooses this rule card, and marks it as shown:the correct answer will then be that a structure must contain exactly two wedges. the moderator then builds and marks this pair of structures:next, the players will start formulating theories about what the rule could be.here are some of the possibilities the players might think of:• must contain only blue pieces.• must contain two pieces not touching.• must contain two pieces pointing in opposite directions.• must contain zero pyramids, or zero weird pieces.• must contain zero red pieces, or zero yellow pieces.• must contain at least one flat piece.the first player creates this structure, and says “tell”:it doesn’t follow the rule, so the moderator marks it with a black token.then the next player builds this structure, and says “quiz.” after everyone guesses, the moderator marks it with a white token. 3turn ordereach player’s turn has three phases:1) build a new structure2) choose “tell” or “quiz”3) make a guess, or pass1)  bu i ld  a n ew structurecreate a new structure using one or more pieces from the global supply. place it near the others, but not too near. you may arrange its pieces in any fashion, including leaning pieces against each other and stacked up in various ways.2 )  cho ose “te ll” or “quiz”tell: if you choose “tell,” the moderator will mark your new structure with a white or black token to indicate whether your structure follows or does not follow the hidden rule.quiz: if you choose “quiz,” all players must guess whether your new structure follows the rule or not. each player picks up their pair of answering tokens and hides their answer (black or white) in one fist. hold that fist out over the playing field, and wait for everyone else to do the same. when everyone is ready, all will reveal their guesses. the moderator will mark the structure with the correct answer, then they will award a guessing token to each player who answered the quiz correctly.3)  make   a  guess, or passpayment required: you can only make an official guess if you’ve earned a guessing token in a quiz. you may choose to spend one or more guessing tokens to try to guess the moderator’s rule, or you can pass and save up your guesses for later. to make a guess, hand a guessing token to the moderator, then state your guess as clearly as you can.clarify the guess: if the moderator does not fully understand your guess, or if it is ambiguous in some way, the moderator will ask clarifying questions until the uncertainty has been resolved. your guess is not considered to be official until both you and the moderator agree that it is official. at any time before that, you may retract your guess and take back your token, or you may change your guess. if any structure on the table contradicts your 4   guess, the moderator should point this out, and you may take back your token or change your guess. it is the moderator’s responsibility to make certain that a guess is unambiguous and is not contradicted by an existing structure. all players are encouraged to help the moderator with this process.moderator disproves guess: after you and the moderator agree upon an official guess, the moderator will disprove it, if possible. the moderator can disprove a guess in two ways: by building a structure which follows the rule but which your guess says does not, or by building a structure which does not follow the rule but which your guess says does.example: consider the game shown on page 3. suppose a player makes this guess: “the structure must contain at least one flat piece.” the moderator could disprove this guess in either of two ways: by building a structure, marked white, which contains no flat pieces, or by building a structure, marked black, that contains a flat piece. either of these possibilities will show you that the guess is incorrect. a common exchange tends to occur when a moderator sets up a counter-example:moderator: “according to your guess, would this structure follow the rule?”player: “yes.”moderator (marking the new structure with a black token): “well, in fact, it does not follow the rule.”option to repeat: once the moderator has built a counter-example and marked it appropriately, you may spend another guessing token, if you have one, to take another guess. you may spend as many of your guessing tokens as you wish during this portion of your turn. when you are finished, the action passes to the next player.","['Induction', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']"

with an arch.d. build on any bricks  you may build on any bricks that have an open knob, including decoration bricks.but you may not build on the two center knobs of the arches.e. attach the staircase a staircase must attach to at least one of the bricks already on the ground map.very rarely, a player is not able to attach their staircase to the existing build on the ground map. in such cases the player takes their recurring delivery of building bricks and waits until the next round.f. support the staircase  each building brick in your staircase must be fully supported.g. arch on arch is not allowed you may not place an arch directly on top of another arch.h. directions  a staircase may turn 90 degrees.i. use arches only as direct steps  a staircase must make a direct path from the ground

dur-ing your first turn as well as on any turn in which you don’t have a terrain tile “in hand”.  2. move your explorer and/or ship tokensyou may move any combination of explorer and/or ship tokens. you are allowed three spaces of movement in total, on land or sea. for example, you can move two explorer tokens one space each to get them onto a ship, and then move the ship in question one space. the  goal  is  to  get  your  explorers  onto  the  ships  and  get  them  to neighboring  isles.  read  the  “moving  explorers  and  ships”  section later for more details. 3. remove a terrain tileyou  must  carefully  remove  a terrain  tile  from  the  island.  any explorer on that tile is now on the sea space it previously occu-pied. take a look at the back of the tile without showing it to other players and refer to the “using information from a terrain tile” section later on for more details.you must respect two conditions when you remove a terrain tile. first,  you  must  choose  a  tile  adjacent  to  at  least  one  sea  space (even if it’s a space which previously had a terrain tile). second, all of the beach tiles must be removed first, followed by the forest tiles,  and  finally  the  mountain  tiles  –  this  is  to  represent  the terrain being closer to the sea sinking first. if a beach tile is com-pletely surrounded by forest and/or mountain tiles, remove it as the last beach tile (even if it not adjacent to a sea space). the same goes for any forest tile surrounded by mountains.3  4. roll the die and move a creatureyou must roll the creature die.then, you may move a creature (sea serpent, shark or whale) corresponding  to  the  die  result  and  already  on  the  game  board one or more sea spaces in order to attack another player or protect one of your own explorers. read the “using a die result” section below for more details. using a die resultthe sea serpents, sharks and whales have no effect on each other. they can occupy the same sea space. if the creature rolled isn’t present on the board, nothing happens.sea serpentif the die result is a sea serpent, move one of these creatures  one  sea  space.  if  the  sea  serpent  enters  a  sea  space occupied  by  a  ship  containing  passengers,  remove  that  ship and any passengers from the game. also remove any swimmers on the sea space. if it was an empty ship, it remains in play.sharkif the die result is a shark, move one of these creatures one or two sea spaces. if the shark enters a sea space occupied by one or more swimmers, the shark’s movement ends. remove all swimmers from the sea space when the shark has stopped. if the space on which the shark is contains a ship, the shark doesn’t affect it (or any passengers it may have).whaleif  the  die  result  is  a  whale,  move  one  of  these creatures one to three sea spaces. if the whale enters a sea space occupied by a ship containing one or more passengers, its move-ment ends: the ship is removed from the game and its passengers become swimmers. if the sea space also contained a shark, the swimmers  are  removed  from  the  game.  a  whale doesn’t affect swimmers or empty ships on the same sea space as itself.  moving explorers and ships explorers on land•  you can move an explorer token from a terrain tile to an adja-cent terrain tile, even if the latter is already occupied by one or more explorer tokens.•  you can move an explorer token from a terrain tile to a ship located on an adjacent sea space.•  you can move an explorer token from a ship to another ship on an adjacent sea space.•  you can move an explorer token onto a ship already occupied by explorers of another color (but no more than 3 per ship).•  you cannot move another player’s explorer tokens.•  once an explorer token leaves the island (by getting on a ship or becoming a swimmer), it can no longer return onto a terrain tile.  explorers on sea (swimmers)•  explorer tokens become swimmers when they move into a sea space from an adjacent terrain tile, when they jump from a ship into the sea space on which that ship is, when they fall into a sea space when a terrain tile is removed, or when a whale capsizes their ship and makes them fall into the sea space it occupied.•  you  can  move  a  swimmer  only  one  sea  space  on  your  turn. when  a  swimmer  goes  from  a terrain  tile  or  ship  into  a  sea space, it’s considered to be a movement of one sea space.•  you may not move a swimmer from a sea space into a boat in an adjacent sea space (since this would be considered 2 movements, and a swimmer may move only one sea space in a turn). you can only move a swimmer onto a ship when they occupy the same sea space.•  a sea space can hold multiple swimmers.•  if  you  move  a  swimmer  into  a  sea  space containing  a  sea  serpent  or  a  shark,  the swimmer is immediately removed from the  game.  consequently,  swimmers cannot cross that kind of sea spaces.4    tiles to be played immediately (green outline)if you see one of these icons, immediately reveal the tile to the other players, perform the actions given below, and then remove the terrain tile from the game.take  a  shark  token  that  had  been  set  aside and  place  it  on  the  sea  space  that  had  been occupied  by  the terrain  tile.  any  swimmer on that sea space is removed from the game.take a whale token that had been set aside and place it on the sea space that had been occupied by the terrain tile. take a ship token that had been set aside and place it on the sea space that had been occu-pied by the terrain tile. if that sea space con-tained one or more swimmers, place them on board the ship. if the sea space contained more than three swimmers, it’s the player who has revealed  the  terrain  tile  who  chooses  which ones get on board.whirlpool:  remove  from  the  game  all swimmers,  sea  serpents,  sharks,  whales, ships and explorers from the sea space the terrain tile used to occupy, as well as from all adjacent sea spaces.volcanic  eruption:  refer  to  the  “end  of game” section later for more details.  ships•  when a ship is empty, any player can move it from one sea space to another, as desired (at the cost of one movement per space).•  a given sea space can only contain one ship at any time.•  each ship can only carry a maximum of three explorer tokens (regardless of color).•  when a ship contains explorers belonging to more than a single player,  it’s  the  player  with  the  most  explorers  on  board  who controls the ship. when you control a ship, you’re the only one who can move it.•  when multiple players have the same number of explorers in a ship, each player controls the ship.•  if you move a ship containing one or more explorers into a sea space containing a sea serpent or a whale, the ship is immedi-ately removed from the game, its passengers becoming swimmers (don’t forget that if the sea space contains a shark or sea serpent, these swimmers are immediately removed from the game). reaching a safe isle•  explorers can disembark from a ship placed on one of the two sea spaces adjacent to one of the safe isles. each explorer token leaving the ship costs one movement. the ship remains on the same sea space until moved again.•  moving a swimmer onto a safe isle from one of the two adjacent sea spaces costs one movement.•  your explorers can disembark on any safe isle, not just the one in front of you.  using information  from a terrain tilewhen you remove a terrain tile (step #3 from the game  overview,  seen  previously),  discreetly look underneath it without showing it to the other  players.  there  are  three  types  of  tiles, each of which is played differently:1. to be played immediately.2. to be played at the beginning of your turn.3.  to  be  played  outside  of  your  turn (defensively).5  tiles to be played  at the beginning of your turn (red outline)if you see one of these icons, place the tile face down in front of you (in your “hand” of tiles). then, once per turn, during step #1 of your game turn, as indicated in the game overview section, you can play one (and only one) of these tiles from your hand.once a tile is played in this manner, remove it from the game.a  dolphin  comes  to  help  one  of  your swimmers!  move  one  of  your  swimmers 1 to 3 sea spaces.the winds favor you! move a ship you con-trol 1 to 3 sea spaces.move the sea serpent of your choice (already present on the game board) to any vacant sea space of your choice.move the shark of your choice (already pres-ent  on  the  game  board)  to  any  vacant  sea space of your choice.move the whale of your choice (already pres-ent  on  the  game  board)  to  any  vacant  sea space of your choice.  tiles to be played  outside of your turn (defensively) (red outline)finally,  if  you  see  one  of  these  icons,  place  the  tile  face  down in  front  of  you  (in  your  “hand”  of  tiles),  as  the  side  with  the icon should remain hidden. these tiles can only be played dur-ing  another  player’s  turn,  and  not  on  your  own.  they  are  con-sidered  to  be  “defense”  tiles,  as  they  are  played  in  reaction  to  a creature’s movement made by an opponent. once such a tile has been played, remove it from the game. here’s how they should be resolved:when another player moves a shark onto a sea space occupied by one of your swimmers, you can play this terrain tile to remove the shark from the game (before your swimmer is removed from the game by the shark). all swimmers remain in the sea space.when another player moves a whale onto a sea space occupied by one of your ships, you can play this terrain tile to remove the whale from the game (before it gets to capsize your ship). your ship remains in the sea space.

to the center of the play area.gameplay changessome cards display animals on them. when placing a card that displays an animal, a player may place a matching animal token onto the center of that card. this decision of whether to add a matching animal token can be made only during the turn that the card is placed.note: the animal token should always be positi oned on the center of the card because it is linked only to the single long trail on the card — never to the two short trails — for gameplay purposes.if a player chooses to place an animal token on a card, that card may never be overlapped by other cards.designer’s note: trail cards that display animals always consist of two short trails that do not match the long trail type. also note that each long trail shape is linked to a speciﬁ c animal type — this is useful to know when planning your routes.scoring for animalsplayers will score additi onal points for each completed loop based on the number of unique animal tokens that were

so if one player sells an item there, later another player can buy that item. similarly, when one player buys something, it becomes unavailable to others. item prices are equal to their printed value, both when buying and selling.during each trade a player may sell and buy any number of items.besides trading, players may also use money for  other purposes if the app allows it: paying coins to bribe, to repay debts, or even to throw coins somewhere. in cases like these, put used coins back into the general supply.experienceyou gain experience points as a result of certain interactions. at any moment during your turn, except during a test, you may spend your gained experience points to upgrade your skills. for each experience point spent, you may move any of your skill markers a total of 2 spaces left (either moving 1 marker 2 spaces left, or 2 different markers each 1 space left on the same track or on different tracks). there can never be 2 skill markers in the same space of a skill track.   skill gain and loss actions may result in you gaining or losing skill. the app instructs you to move your skill markers of a specified skill to the left (when gaining) or to the right (when losing). the app tells the total number of spaces to move, but you decide how to distribute these moves among your skill markers on that track. both skill loss and skill gain are permanent. some items let you lose some skill in exchange for some other reward. a specific skill may be lost, or you may be able to choose.some items and interactions may cause you to gain skills by moving skill markers to the left, the same way as when upgrading. itemseach player’s inventory is limited to 5 item cards. if you get more, you must get rid of excess items to reduce back to 5 immediately. you can either abandon an excess item, or use its discard ability and then discard it back to the box.when you abandon an item, place it near the map. take a pair of unused trade stack markers, put 1 marker onto the abandoned card, and the matching marker onto the map tile where the character is to shows where the item was dropped. from now on, any player who visits any point of interest on this map tile may, as a free action, pick up this item card and add it to their inventory.item special abilities are of 2 types: always, which means that the ability is active as long as the character has the item in their inventory, or discard, which means that to use the ability, the owning player must return the item card to the box.you may use your item abilities freely in any order during your turn. if an item ability does not specify the exact moment when it should be used, you are allowed to use it in any moment of their turn, as you wish.if it ever happens that the result of a player combining several actions seems ambiguous, choose the resolution most favorable for that player.eventswhen an event is triggered, the active player follows the app’s instructions. events may change the state of points of interest. such events might happen, for example, when an npc arrives at a location, or moves to another location.

some have immediate effects. phase iii – settle each settler is placed on the top tile of the world construction stack. when settlers equal its cost, the world is completed and moved into your tableau. settlers who completed it go to the citizenry. worlds provide immediate effects such as galactic credits or new dice. unused settlers after all worlds are complete return to the cup. phase iv – produce each producer creates a good on a non-gray world in your tableau. the producer die itself becomes the good and is placed on that world. a world can hold only one good (unless you have a power allowing more). return unused producers to the cup. phase v – ship each shipper takes a good from a world and either trades or consumes it. after either action, place both dice (the good and the shipper) into your citizenry. •  trade: earn galactic credits based on the world’s color: o  novelty (cyan): $3 o  rare elements (brown): $4 o  genes (green): $5 o  alien technology (yellow): $6 •  consume: earn victory point chips. o  1 vp always o  +1 vp if the good matches the world’s color o  +1 vp if the shipper matches the world’s color a purple (consumption) die counts as all colors for vp purposes and always gives +1 vp. when the initial vp chip supply runs out, add the set-aside 10-vp chips and continue. if this occurs, it triggers the game end after the current round. 5. manage empire after all phases are resolved: 1.  recruit workers: spend 1 credit per die to move dice from your citizenry into your cup. if you reach $0, move your marker to $1. you may choose which dice to recruit if you cannot afford them all.  2.  recall dice: you may freely recall any developers, settlers, or goods into your cup. this does not cost credits. if your cup is empty after recruiting, you must recall at least one die. 3.  reset phases: flip all phase tiles back to their inactive side. 4.  check game end: the game ends if the vp supply is empty or any player has 12+ tile squares in their tableau.

the beginning of each age, each player receives a hand of 7 cards, dealt randomly, from the corresponding deck.each age is made up of 6 game turns. during each turn the players put into play a single card, simultaneously.a game turn takes place as follows :•  1. choose a card•  2. action•   3. give your hand of cards to the player sitting to your left or right and receive another hand of cards from the player sitting next to you.1. choose a cardeach player looks at their hand without showing it to other players and selects a card before placing it face down before them.the remaining cards are placed between their left-hand neighbor and themselves (see end of an age).2. actiononce every player has selected his or her card, they perform their action simultaneously.three actions are possible with the chosen card :•  a. build the structure•  b. build a stage of their wonder•  c. discard the card to gain 3 coinsnote : during your ﬁ rst game, you can follow the action of each player, one after the other, to become more familiar with the game...2.a. build the structuremost often, the player will build the structure represented by the selected card (see construction in 7 wonders).important : a player can never build two identical structures (meaning those with the same name/the same illustration).card placementthe brown and gray cards are placed beneath one another starting from the upper left corner of the wonders board. this allows players to quickly see all resources produced by each player.the other cards are placed face up, in the area in front of the player’s wonders board. all of this area corresponds to a player’s city.in order to save space, stack your cards by color while leaving the name of each structure visible.2.b. build a stage of a wonderto build each stage of his or her wonder, the player will use a card of their choice as a construction marker :to do that, the player must pay the price shown on the wonder board and not the one shown on the structure’s card.the player then plays the card, face down, half hidden under the wonder board to show that this stage of their wonder is now built. the card then has no other effect, and is not considered to be a structure.example : a player wants to build the second stage of his wonder, the lighthouse of alexandria. he chooses one card from his hand. his city grants him the two units of ore required for his construction, he the-refore places his card in front of the wonder stage, half covered by his board in order to indicate that this stage has been constructed.clariﬁ cation :•   the stages of a wonder must be built in order, meaning from left to right.•   the construction of the wonder is not mandatory. a player can win the game without having ﬁ nished (or even started) the construction of his or her wonder.•   the card used to mark the construction of a wonder stage remains hidden. players would be advised to use a card they do not want to give their neighbor (see move on to the next hand).•   most wonders have 3 stages but these are not associated with ages. it is therefore possible to build multiple wonder stages in a single age or to begin construction during age iii.•   each stage can only built once per game.2.c. discard the card to gain 3 coinsa player can choose to discard his or her card to take 3 coins from the bank and add them to his or her treasury.the cards discarded this way remain face down and form a discard pile in the center of the table. it can be useful to discard a card you cannot build but which would be of interest to your neighbor.note : if a player has chosen a card but is unable to build either the struc-ture or the wonder stage, that player is then forced to discard the card and takes 3 coins from the bank.3. move on to the next handeach player takes the hand of cards handed from his or her neighbor.be careful : the direction of the hands rotation changes with each age :· 5 ·end of the gamethe game ends at the end of the third age, after the conﬂ ict tokens have been handed out.each player totals their civilization points and the player with the highest total is declared the winner.in case of a tie, the player with the most coins in his or her treasury is the winner. a tie on coins is not broken further.note : a booklet of scorecards is in the box to help you count the points for your ﬁ rst few games... or keep track of your more memorable games !totalling the pointscount the victory points in this order :•  1. military conﬂ icts•  2. treasury contents•  3. wonder•  4. civilian structures•  5. scientiﬁ c structures•  6. commercial structures•  7. guilds1. military conﬂ ictseach player adds their victory and defeat tokens (this total can be negative !).example : alexandria has ﬁ nished the game with the following tokens : +1, +3, +5, -1, -1, -1 for a total of 6 points.2. treasury contentsfor every 3 coins in their possession at the end of the game, players score 1 victory point. leftover coins score no points.example : alexandria has ﬁ nished the game with 14 coins in their treasury, which earns them 4 victory points (4 sets of 3 coins plus one partial set).3. wonderseach player then adds to their score the victory points from their wonder.example : alexandria has built all 3 stages of their wonder (side a) ; 10  victory points (3 for the ﬁ rst phase and 7 for the third) are added to their total.4. civilian structureseach player adds the victory points of their civilian structures. this amount is indicated on each civilian structure.example : alexandria has built the following civilian structures : altar (2vp), aqueduct (5vp) and town hall (6vp) for a total of 13 victory points.5. scientiﬁ c structuresthe scientiﬁ c cards earn victory points in two very different ways : from sets of identical symbols and from sets of 3 different symbols.be careful : the victory points earned by both methods are cumulative.sets of identical symbolsfor each of the 3 existing scientiﬁ c symbols, the player wins the following points :•  only 1 symbol : 1 victory point•  2 identical symbols : 4 victory points•  3 identical symbols : 9 victory points•  4 identical symbols : 16 victory pointsnote :- the number of points gained is equal to the number of symbols squared.- there are 4 green cards for each symbol, for a maximum of 16 victory points per family of symbols.- this maximum can be increased with the scientiﬁ c guild and the won-der of babylon : 5 identical symbols earn 25 victory points and 6 identi-cal symbols earn 36 victory points.example : alexandria has built 6 scientiﬁ c structures with the following symbols : 3 3 , 2 2 , 1 1 . they score 9 points for the family of 3 3  (3x3), 4 points for its  (1x1), for a total of 14 victory points. (2x2) and ﬁ nally 1 for the sets of 3 different symbolsfor each group of 3 different symbols, each player scores 7 victory points.example : continuing the above example, alexandria has built 6 scien-tiﬁ c structures but only has a single group of 3 different symbols, they score 7 extra points for a total of 21 victory points.if alexandria had built an extra structure with the would’ve scored : (9 + 4 + 4) + (7 + 7) = 31 victory points. symbol, they 6. commercial structuressome commercial structures from age iii grant victory points.example : alexandria has built the chamber of commerce. this structure is worth 2 victory points for each gray card present in their city. alexan-dria has played two gray cards : 4 victory points.7. guildseach guild is worth a number of victory points depending on the conﬁ gu-ration of the player’s city and/or that of the two neighboring cities (see description of the structures).strategic advices•  block your opponents : to win at 7 wonders, you must keep an eye on your two neighboring cities to analyze their strategy. try to block them by using the cards which would give them an advantage. you can use them to build your wonder stages or by discarding them when you need coins.•  strategies : multiple strategies can lead to victory : specialize in struc-tures of a single color or collect the different types of structures, wage war or neglect your military, producing goods in abundance or rely on commerce...•  the march of progress : if you build scientiﬁ c structures, try to make groups of different symbols, as they tend to earn more points.· 6 ·“expert” variant for 2 playersthe following rule adjustments allow play with 2 players.in addition to the standard game material, you’ll need the two speciﬁ c cards found in the box.be careful : we suggest you play a few games with 3-7 players before trying the game in its 2-player variant !1. choose a cardthe player who holds the free city card in his or her hand takes the ﬁ rst card of the draw pile and adds it to their hand.that player will then choose two cards from his or her hand – one for their own city and one for the free city, while his or her opponent chooses their card normally.each player then places the remaining cards on their side of the border card.border cardborder cardfree city cardgame set-upthe players use the same cards as in the 3-player conﬁ guration (3+ cards only).each player is given a board, and then a third board is placed beside them. this board will be called the free city in the rest of this variant.the border card is placed between the two players.each player is given a 7-card hand and the remaining 7 cards make a draw pile, placed face down, to the right of the border card.the player to the left of the free city adds the free city card to his or her hand.the players and the free city each get 3 coins from the bank to start the game.game overviewthe game proceeds the same way as it would with 3 to 7 players.the difference is in the management of the free city : the players will play, in turn and in addition to their own card, a card for it.2. actionthe player holding the free city card plays the free city’s card followed by his or her own while their opponent performs their own action.rules for the free city :•   the free city can purchase resources from both of its neighboring cities as according to the commerce rules. when a resource is avai-lable in both neighboring cities, the player who controls the free city is free to purchase from either one, even if the cost would be less if bought from one player.•   the free city can only discard a card to earn 3 coins if it cannot play one (building structures or a wonder stage).•   if the card chosen for the free city can beneﬁ t from a free construc-tion (chain), this free construction must be performed.note : during the sixth turn of the age, there is only one card remaining in the free city’s draw pile. this last card is discarded at the same time as the seventh and last card of the players.carte cité francheat the end of the turn, ludovic put his cards hereat the end of the turn, pierôput his cards hereborder cardcard played by ludovic for his city3. move on to the next handonce all three cards are played, the players take the stack of cards on the other side of the border. during the next turn, it’s the other player who’ll play for the free city, and so on until the end of the game.example : ludwig and peter start a game. they each get a hand of 7 cards and place a draw pile made up of the 7 remaining cards 7 to the right of the border card. ludwig, to the right of the free city, adds to his hand the free city card. on the ﬁ rst turn of the game, peter chooses one card from his hand to play and ludwig takes the ﬁ rst card of the free city draw pile and adds it to his hand. he then chooses one card for the free city and one for his own city. the players reveal their chosen cards, starting with the free city and play them. then they take the stack of cards on the other side of the border card, so peter winds up with the free city card for the second turn of the game. it’s therefore up to him to draw a card and play for both his city and the neutral city...end of an agethe player who begins with the free city card changes each age :•  age i : the card is held by the player to the left of the free city.•  age ii : the card is held by the player to the right of the free city.•  age iii : the card is held by the player to the left of the free city.the rules for conﬂ ict resolution remain unchanged.","['Closed Drafting', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Melding and Splaying', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Neighbor Scope', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Score-and-Reset

(see end game for final scoring.) o  on a player’s turn, they will carry out 4 phases before the next player takes their turn – playing cards, feeding, aging, and drawing cards. o  refer to the included reference guide for any questions on the 12 basic cards found in the surface deck. o  population and species boards are unlimited.  if the population depletes after end game trigger, use substitute.   o  take note, in this game, the species boards don’t represent a real species, but a new quirky one you are inventing as you play trait cards next to them.  if you understand this concept, it makes the game easier to understand thematically. phase 1 – playing cards: o if the cambrian explosion hasn’t happened (see below), play 1 surface card from your hand (not a deep card.)  if the cambrian explosion has happened, play any 2 cards from your hand, one at a time, according to the following rules.   o  when a card is played, you either migrate population or you evolve a species with the played card.   o  evolving a species:   note:  there is no limit to the number of species you can have in front of you.   when you play a card in order to start a new species, take 1 species board and put it in front of you (fish pointing away.)  place the new species board on either side or in between species you already have.  (see below, adjacency matters!)  the new trait card will be paired with this new species board and be placed to its left.  once a trail card is placed, it is active.   if you want to add a trait card to an existing species, simply play the card with the other trait cards to the left of the species board.  a species may have multiple cards of the same trait, but 3 is the maximum number of trait cards a species may have, unless a trait card allows for more.      you are allowed to play trait cards to a species at its max trait number as long as the new card grants extra traits.     at any time during this phase, you may remove trait cards from any of your species you wish.  surface cards go in the discard pile, and deep cards are removed from the game. o  migration of population:  instead of playing a trait card to evolve a species,  you can discard a trait card to move population from 1 water zone to another water zone.  water zones are the reef, and ocean zone 1, 2, 3.    the number in the bottom left of the trait card you discard is the migration number.  move this amount of population from 1 water zone to any other single water zone.  if the zone you are migrating from has less than the number you can move, only migrate what is there.  do not take extra population from another water zone.      phase 2 – feeding: o  choose 1 of your species (only 1) and that species gets to eat.  a species eats by either foraging for food in the reef or by attacking another species, even another species owned by you! o  the green circle on some trait cards represents “forage” value and the red diamond represents “attack” power.  if a o o o species has no shown forage value among all trait cards, it is understood to have 1 forage.  same goes for attack power. if a species has at least 1 “ø” symbol in the green color on any of their trait cards, it means this species can never forage even if it has traits that give a forage value.  the same goes for attacking.   in order to forage, add up all the green circle values of the foraging species and take that amount of population from the reef (and reef only) and place each population token earned onto an empty space of the foraging species board.   in order to attack, add up all red diamond values of the attacking species and target 1 other species at the table (even one of your own) and remove that amount of population from the targeted species.  add the removed population to the attacker’s species board just as you would if you foraged.     some trait cards have a defense value at the bottom (turtle shell icon.)  when a species is attacked, add up its defense value, this value will “save” this amount of population from being removed by the attacker.  note – the defense value doesn’t reduce the attacking value, just the amount of population lost.      there is no default value for defense.  if a species has no shell icons, it has 0 defense.   o  a species can’t “forage” or “attack” unless it would take at least 1 population, and it must have at least 1 open space on its species board.  population can only go on the fishbone space (overpopulation) if it is the only available space left.   o  a species can’t take more population than allowed on their species board.  (see overpopulation below.) o  when foraging or attacking, a species must take its full amount, if possible.  (can’t take less to avoid overpopulation!) o  the term “leeching” doesn’t mean foraging or attacking.  it is an automatic trait.   o  the term “adjacency” refers to the species directly to the right and left of a given species.  keep in mind, the table acts like a giant circle so my right-most species is adjacent to my right neighbor’s left-most species. o  the blue triangle refers to “gain” value.  when a species “gains” population due to something triggering anywhere at the table, they take population equal to the gain value from ocean zone 1.  when that runs out, take from ocean zone 2, then ocean zone 3.  all “gains” trigger at the same time, but if need be, go in clockwise order. o  overpopulation:  after each feeding, resolve everything that triggers from this feeding and then check for overpopulation.  at this time, if a population token is on the fishbone spot (last space) of a species board, it “overpopulates.”  any species that has this happens removes population until there is only 5 population left on the species board.  place the removed population tokens in any 1 water zone.    if the species you chose to feed during your turn overpopulations, and it still had additional feeding abilities (such as tentacled), it must end its feeding phase now.  however, if another species overpopulations due to your main species feeding this turn, it doesn’t stop your main species from feeding again, if it can do so.    phase 3 – aging: o if the cambrian explosion hasn’t occurred yet, remove 1 population from each of your species boards and place it behind your shield (or place it in your point bag.)  if the cambrian explosion has occurred, removed 2 from each species. o  a species will go “extinct” if, right now, you go to remove the necessary population from a species and you can’t remove the full amount.  remove the population you can from this species and place it behind your shield, then remove all trait cards and the species board for this species.  it no longer exists.  this is the only time a species can go extinct! important – if, after aging, a species has 0 population, it doesn’t go extinct because you were able to remove all population necessary for aging.  make sure to get more population before the next aging phase or else it will go extinct!           o phase 4 – drawing cards: 1.  you may draw 1 deep card (even if the cambrian explosion hasn’t occurred yet – start preparing!)   either draw 1 deep card from the 2 face-up cards of the gene pool…   or draw 3 deep cards from the deck, keep 1, and place the other 2 cards face-up on top of each gene pool pile. 2.  you may now discard any number of surface cards from your hand.  can’t discard any deep cards!   3.  draw from the surface deck until the total number of cards in your hand is 6.    if the surface deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile.   cambrian explosion card: o  when the 1st ocean zone becomes empty, the cambrian explosion card that is located in this zone is removed and o placed for all players to see.  if any population enters the 1st ocean zone again, the cambrian explosion is still in effect. (see card)  from now on, during phase 1, play 2 cards instead of 1 and during phase 3, age 2 population from each species instead of just 1.  also, players can now start to play “deep” trait cards, unless playing the reef variant.      scenario cards: o  when the 1st or 2nd ocean zone with a scenario card becomes empty, that scenario card will come into effect. o if any population is placed back into an empty ocean zone with a scenario card, that card is deactivated.     blue cards are ongoing.  as long as the associated ocean zone is empty, this effect will be active.     purple cards are immediate effects that occur whenever the associated zone is emptied.   o  even though scenario cards activate whenever the zone is emptied, make sure you resolve all trait card triggers (like “gains” and “overpopulation”) before activating the scenario card.   the deep: o  this deck of cards has no duplicate traits so it is not recommended with the reef variant (beginners.)   o  once the cambrian explosion occurs, players may start playing deep cards they have taken into their hands. o  you can play deep cards like any trait card during phase 1, however, if you play a deep card as a trait to evolve a species (not migrate,) you must pay a population cost from your score pile (behind your shield) equal to the deep card’s migrate number.  place this population payment into any 1 water zone.   o  you don’t need to pay a cost when using a deep card for migration.  simply discard the deep card from the game. o  some of the promo deep cards have a “lightning” symbol on them.  these aren’t traits to play with species, but rather events that still require a population payment!

(cards will be drawn from this deck and resolved as new states enter play.)4playing the gamethe first player to finish building his campaign strategy deck may go first. when playing with the preconstructed starting decks, the player closest to his18th birthday (his date of voter eligibility) may go first.play alternates between the two players. on his turn, a player must either:a) play a card from his handwhen a card is played, the instructions on the card are followed. most cards are then placed on the player’s discard pile at the end of the turn. the exceptions to this are media support cards, which remain face-up in play until another media support card is played, causing the older card to be replaced and moved to the owning player’s discard pile.orb) draw a card from his deck.mediasupportinstruction textif a player already has 5 or more cards in his hand, however, he may not choose to draw a card (although he may still play cards which grant additional cards). apart from this restriction, there is no hand size limit. reshufflingif a player wishes to draw a card but has no cards remaining in his campaign deck, his discard pile is first reshuffled to form a new deck. if this occurs in the midst of a player’s turn, any cards played earlier on that turn should not be shuffled into the new deck.gaining supportwhen a card (or event, or going negative result) indicates that a player gains a point of support in a particular issue in a state, this means one voter on the side of the state associated with that issue switches to that player’s color. this can be accomplished in any of three ways (in the examples below, mccain is the current player):players may place a token of their own color onto a voter spot of their opponent’s color.they may remove a token of their opponent’s color from a voter spot of their own color.they may replace a token of their opponent’s color that’s on a white spot with a token of their own color. all of these actions are equivalent, and it doesn’t matter which method players use – all result in a voter of their opponent’s color being replaced with one of their own. (note: players are much less likely to run short of support markers if they remove tokens whenever possible rather than adding new ones.)if the opposing player has no voters to be taken away, the player may instead place one of his tokens on an unoccupied white spot (an undecided voter).  these undecided voter spots will ordinarily be the last voters claimed unless affected by a demographic support card or a breaking news event.note that once either player has placed a support marker onto an undecided voter spot, it is no longer an undecided voter and will never again become one. while a token on one of these spots might be replaced by one belonging to the opposing player, it will never be removed entirely.if all of the voters for an issue are already the player’s color, gaining support in that issue in the same state has no further eﬀect.5shifting a state toward an issuewhen a card (or event, or going negative result) indicates that a player may shift a state toward a particular issue, the state’s issue marker is moved the indicated number of spaces in the specified direction. if the marker is already in the furthest track position in that direction, additional shifts in that direction have no further effect.the term majority issue refers to the issue (defense or economy) that the issue marker currently points to; the term minority issue refers to the other issue.example: the current majority issue in this state is defense. the active player plays a card which allows him to shift the issue track in a single state 1 space towards economy. he does so, and swivels the marker to match the space it now occupies. since the marker now points towards the economy symbol, economy becomes this state’s majority issue. altering the key demographic in a statewhen a card (or event, or going negative result) indicates that a player may alter the key demographic in a state, the state’s key demographic marker is shifted to the other demographic, making it the new key demographic in the state.the current key demographic in this state is college graduates. the active player plays a card which allows him to alter the key demographic in a single state. he moves the marker to the other position, and catholics become the key demographic for this state.the key demographic in a state is significant when demographic support cards are played from a player’s hand. these cards make undecided voters in all in-play states with a particular key demographic give their support to the player. note that states where that demographic appears but where it is not the key demographic are not affected. furthermore, undecided voters who have already given their support to a candidate are also unaffected.demographicsupportexample: mccain plays the “divided we fail” demographic support card, which affects all states with seniors as the key demographic. colorado is the only such state in play, so the three undecided voters in the state become red voters.  discarding cards for effectsome cards indicate that a player may discard additional cards from their hand to gain some effect. these cards may not be played without discarding the required number of cards. of course, if a card indicates that a player may discard “any number” of cards, zero is a legal choice.similarly, a campaign strategy card may be played even though it has no effect, in order to remove the card from your hand and progress the turn.going negativesome cards feature a large die icon. these cards represent “negative campaigning” that has a chance of causing a minor backlash against the player. whenever a player elects to go negative by playing one of these cards, he must roll a die at the end of his turn and consult the results chart to determine the effect, in the form of a bonus granted to the opposing player. the opposing player may then apply the bonus.6winning a stateif at any time all of the voters on the majority issue side of a state are in support of a single candidate (i.e., all the voters on the side currently pointed at by the issue marker are either red or blue), that player immediately wins the state and claims its scoring tile, placing it on his scoring track with his own color showing.claimed scoring tiles are laid out end to end in a row along the scoring track starting from the far left. (note that obama has two electoral votes pre-printed on his scoring track; the player representing him should be careful to line up any scoring tiles with these (not directly against the edge of the track) so as not to “lose credit” for these two votes.)example: early in the game, mccain has already won oregon (or) and iowa (ia), so those scoring markers are already on his scoring track displaying a score of 169. obama wins virginia (va), so takes that scoring tile and places it blue-side-up on his own scoring track as shown (remembering to not cover up his 2 pre-printed votes); obama squeaks into the lead with 170 votes!winning a state (along with the accompanying steps described below) occurs immediately when a player achieves the necessary support, before rolling the die for going negative. if multiple states are won simultaneously, each is resolved one at a time as described below, in the order desired by the current player.bringing new states into playwhenever a player wins a state, that state is removed from play and replaced with a new state from those which have not yet been brought into the game (all such states are eligible; the color/logo on the backs is only relevant during starting setup). the player who won the state chooses which new state will be brought in, even if it is currently the opposing player’s turn. if all states have already been brought into play, no further states can be added and the game will continue with a reduced number of states in play. the issue and key demographic markers from the old state are placed into the indicated spaces on the new one, and all support markers from the old state return to their  owners.example: as seen above, obama has won virginia. he removes the virginia tile from play, returning the support markers there to the appropriate owner. next he decides which state he wants to replace it with, and settles on nevada. he puts the nevada tile in the space vacated by virginia, and positions the issue and key demographic markers in their indicated spots. breaking newsevery time a new state is brought into play (not counting the four starting states), a card is drawn from the breaking news deck and resolved (by following its instruction text). by default, this event affects the new state which just entered the game, unless the effect of a media support card dictates otherwise. if multiple states are being brought into play, an event is drawn and resolved for each one as it is added, before introducing the next. once resolved, breaking news cards are removed from the game.it is possible that a breaking news event might result in additional states being won by one player or the other. as in any case when multiple states have been won, the current player may decide the order in which they are resolved.instructiontext7winning the gameeach candidate comes into the game with a slightly different number of electoral votes already “locked up” in non-battleground states. therefore, each player needs a slightly different number of additional votes to achieve the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the election. mccain requires 115 additional votes to win; obama needs another 113 votes. (this perceived advantage is offset by mccain’s entering the game with a slight edge in battleground states worth a few more total votes than those favoring obama.)during the game, players will be filling up their scoring tracks with scoring tiles as they win states. if a player claims sufficient scoring tiles to extend his collection far enough to reach or pass the 270 mark, he immediately wins the game!example: it’s been a hard-fought battle with both candidates winning many states and securing a good number of electoral votes. the current score is mccain 258, obama 263. it all comes down to the final battleground state of ohio. through some shrewd campaigning, mccain manages to win the state! ohio’s scoring tile puts mccain clearly past the 270 votes needed to ","['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Simulation']"

carnivore gains meat food equal to attacked species’ body size. •  feeding ends when no species are hungry or no food can be eaten. •  excess food goes into each player’s food bag. •  species reduced to 0 population go extinct (see extinction rules). extinction •  discard trait cards from extinct species.  •  draw 1 card per discarded trait. •  discard species board; place food from board into food bag. •  close gaps if species was between two others. end-of-game scoring players receive points for: •  food collected during the game (1 point per food token) •  population of surviving species (1 point per population unit) •  trait cards on surviving species (1 point each) the winner is the player with the most points. in case of a tie, use trait card points, then population points. if still tied, order pizza and play again. trait cards examples of important traits: •  ambush – ignore warning call for carnivores. •  burrowing – protects from predators and extreme climates. •  carnivore – eats other species, never plant food. •  climbing – only attacked by carnivores with climbing. •  cooling frills – increase effective body size, reduce heat loss. •  cooperation – adjacent species gain food. •  defensive herding – requires predator with larger population to attack. •  fat tissue – stores extra food. •  foraging – eat 1 additional plant food. •  heavy fur – reduces cold population loss, increases heat vulnerability. •  hibernation – ignores up to 2 hungry population. intelligence – discard cards to gain extra food or neutralize enemy traits. • •  long neck – take food from the food bank before food cards are revealed. •  migratory – gains food from food bank if watering hole is empty. •  mud wallowing – protects from heat, requires card discard to attack. •  nocturnal – may feed species outside normal turn. •  pack hunting – body size treated as population + body size for attacks. •  scavenger – gains extra meat when species attacked. •  symbiosis – protected if right-adjacent species is larger. •  warning call – protects adjacent species unless predator has ambush. climate event cards •  cold snap: overrides current climate effects for the round.     •  desertification: all species lose 1 body size (min 1). •  heat wave: overrides current climate effects for the round. •  glacial thaw: adds 3 sun icons to the next round’s climate calculation. •  meteorite: removes/limits food; normal heat/cold population loss applies. •  volcanic eruption: moves climate marker to a designated zone next round. •  wildfire: species without burrowing lose 1 population; watering hole food delayed. game variants •  quick play (6 players) – faster rounds. •  2-player variant – max 3 traits per species. •  no climate events – recommended for beginners. credits •  project manager: dominic crapuchettes, dmitry knorre, sergey machin •  game developers: jonathan d’angelo, ben goldman, nick bentley, scott rencher •  card & box artist: catherine hamilton •  graphic design: jacoby o’connor, ben goldman •  scientific advisors: dr. giles young, dr. joanne demmler, dr. stuart west •  production manager: edoardo kulp •  playtesters & special thanks: various contributors and kickstarter backers. original concept: dmitry knorre, russian biologist. enhanced & developed: dominic crapuchettes and team. this version is fully structured, readable, and ready for printing or digital reference. if you want, i can also make a 1–2 page visual cheat sheet of all the rules, phases, and traits so it’s easy to reference during gameplay. do you want me to do that next?","['Action Points', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Progressive']"

a card and checking the clearingeach card has either one tree or two forest dwellers:•  each tree card features exactly one type of tree, around which you can place animals, plants, and mushrooms. trees are the basis of your forest.•  all other cards are split in two: either horizontally, featuring one forest dweller on the top and another on the bottom, or vertically, featuring one each on the left and right.all cards are laid out as follows:costtype symboleffect (on some cards)illustration711tawny owl point valuenamecard color with tree symbolstag beetlethe number of this species that exist in the gamebonus (on some cards)3playing a cardto play a card from your hand, you must first pay its cost by placing that many (other) cards from your hand face up into the clearing. when playing a split card, choose one half to play and pay only its cost.normally, it does not matter which cards you discard as payment. some species, however, provide a bonus if you pay with specific cards (see “bonus” on page 6).then, place the card face up in fron of yourself. your collection of played cards is called your forest.note: split cards must always be placed next to a tree (see below). the total of your played cards constitutes your forest.treestrees provide card slots for split cards on each of their four sides: top, bottom, left, and right. as long as there is no card played to a card slot, it is considered empty; a tree is considered fully occupied if there is at least one card on each of its four sides.top450leftrightwhenever you play a tree, you must also draw

like  a  tree,  a  tree  sapling  provides  a  card  slot  on  each  of its four sides. however, it does not belong to any of the eight tree species and is not considered a tree species of its own.animals, plants, and mushroomsthe split cards feature varying inhabitants of the forest: animals, plants, or mushrooms.when playing a split card, you must place it in an empty slot on the corresponding side of a tree in your forest. if you wish to play an inhabitant on the left side of a card, it must be placed on the left side of a tree; to do so, slide the unused right half of the card under the tree. the same rules apply to inhabitants on the right, top, or bottom halves of cards.note: only the inhabitant that is still visible after the card has been placed counts as being in your forest. the hidden half is not relevant for the remainder of the game or for scoring.501640example: you have just added this squeaker to your forest by sliding the right half of the card under the sycamore tree.squeakerred deersycamorenote: split cards can only be played if one of your trees has an empty card slot available on the corresponding side.effect and bonusif the card you just played has an effect or bonus (or both), you may now use them. if you wish to use both, you must use the effect before using the bonus. using an effect or bonus is optional.card effects and bonuses are explained with either icons or short descriptions. you can find an overview of all symbols on the last page of this rulebook. if you would like a more detailed explanation, consult the reference cards or the digital appendix (see qr code).appendix5effectsthere are two types of effects:061•  most cards provide an instant effect that can be used once immediately after playing it.•  mushrooms,  however,  provide  a  permanent  effect,  which  you  can  use  for  the  rest  of  the chaffi  nchgame, beginning on your next turn.if on a beechmushroomsmushrooms  have  an  effect  when  certain  cards  are  placed  in  your forest  (e.g.,  below  a  tree).  each  time  you  place  such  a  card  in  your forest, you may use the mushroom’s effect immediately.parasol mushroomwhenever you play a card below a tree:example: you have just played a parasol mushroom. starting on your next turn, whenever you place a card in a card slot below a tree, you may draw the top card from the deck.980bonus

number of discs you think you can flip over without revealing a skull.setupeach player chooses a set, places their mat in front of them on the table, blank side up, and takes their 4 discs. the player to have most recently given someone flowers (or a skull) is the first player.a 3 player  setup3game round1) getting ready2) decision makingto  begin  the  round,  each  player  secretly chooses a disc from their hand and places  it  facedown  on  their  mat.  the  first  player must wait until all other players have placed a disc before choosing their own.this choice is essential: if you place a flower, you give yourself a chance of winning the round. if you place a skull, you are unlikely to win  the round, but can hope  to make winning more difficult  for your opponents.once everyone has placed a disc facedown, players  take  turns,  starting  with  the  first player and proceeding clockwise.on  your  turn,  you  can  place  a  disc  or open  the  bidding.  once  the  bidding has been opened, your options change to outbid or pass.after you take your turn, play proceeds to the next player in clockwise order.place a disc choose 1 of your remaining discs and place it facedown on your previously played disc (offset by a little so that everyone can see how many discs are in play).4 open the bidding  if  you  cannot  or  simply  do  not  want  to place  a  disc,  you  can  open  the  bidding by  announcing  the  number  of  discs  you will attempt to flip over without revealing a  skull.  this  number  must  be  less  than or  equal  to  the  number  of  discs  in  play (placed on player mats), and must also be greater than zero.by opening the bidding, you are  attempting to win the round. this is  one of the most critical moments  of the round. once  any  player  has  opened  the  bidding, you can no longer place discs on your mat.  instead, on your turn you must now either outbid or pass.5◉ outbidto outbid, indicate that you will attempt to flip more discs without revealing a skull by announcing  a  number  greater  than  the current bid (but still less than or equal to the number of discs in play).◉ passpush your mat to the center of the table to  indicate  that  you  no  longer  wish  to  participate  in  this  round  of  bidding. your discs  remain  on  your  mat  and  may  be  flipped by whoever wins the bid.count all the discs in play  and take your best guess at how  many of them are flowers.your new bid can be higher than  the previous bid by any amount.play  continues  clockwise  until  all  but  one  player  have  passed.  the  remaining player  wins  the  bid  and  becomes  the round’s challenger.6  3) resolve the challenge successif  you  flip  the  number  of  discs  you  bid  without  revealing  a  skull,  you  win  the round.  if your player mat is blank side up, flip it so it is flower side up.  if it is already flower side up, you win the game!as the challenger, you must flip a number of discs equal to your bid without revealing a skull.  if your bid was equal to the number of discs in play, you must flip every disc. when flipping discs, follow these rules:• you must flip discs one at a time.• you cannot flip other players’ discs until all of your own discs have been flipped.• you can only flip the topmost facedown disc on any mat (i.e. you cannot flip discs that are below other facedown discs).once they have flipped all of their  own discs, the challenger can  freely switch between player mats  as they flip others’ discs.7failureas the challenger, if you flip a skull, you fail and must immediately stop flipping discs. retrieve all your placed discs, shuffle them with those you did not place, and present them facedown to the player whose skull you  revealed.  that  player  takes  one  of your discs and returns it to the box without  looking at it. if you reveal your own skull, you take all your discs (placed and unplaced) into your hand and secretly choose one to return to the  box,  without  revealing  it.  if  you  lose your last disc, return your mat to the game box. you are eliminated from the game. even though the challenger  cannot flip discs after revealing a skull, the other players  may flip theirs to show whether  or not they were bluffing...8new roundregardless  of  whether  the  challenger  wins  or  fails,  everyone  retrieves  their played discs.if the former challenger was not eliminated, they  become  the  first  player  for  the  new round.  otherwise,  the  player  whose  skull eliminated the former challenger becomes the first player. if the challenger eliminated themselves, they choose the first player.the  new  round  begins  with  1)  getting ready  (page  4)  and  play  continues  until the game ends in one of two ways.","['Auction /

face-down into the middle. for each type of vote, the top vote card from the vote deck is also placed face-down in the middle. all cards in the middle are then shuffled and revealed, and the result of the vote is carried out.          after the vote is complete, mix and place all played vote cards face-down at the bottom of the vote deck. each player who participated in the vote draws a new vote card from the top of the vote deck. attack   the captain of a ship may call for an attack as their action. if the captain is the only player on the ship, he may still call for an attack. only players on the attack-ing captain’s ship participate in the vote.   only the top section of the vote card matters in an attack and contains a cannon, a torch, or water. every 1 water cancels out 1 torch. if there is at least 1 cannon, and at least 1 “successful” torch played in the vote, the captain may take 1 piece of treasure from the spanish galleon and place it in either hold on his ship. if the spanish galleon is out of treasure the captain may take 1 piece of treasure from either treasure hold on the other pirate ship (flying dutchman or jolly roger), even if the other ship has no pawns on it, and place it in either hold on his ship.example: if 2 cannons, 1 torch, and 1 water were played, the attack would fail since the water cancelled the torch and there were no “successful” torches.example: if 1 cannon, 2 torches, and 1 water were played, the attack would succeed since there is 1 cannon and only 1 of the torches was cancelled by water, thus leaving 1 “successful” torch.example: if 2 cannons and 2 torches were played, the attack would succeed. however, you still only take 1 piece of treasure.brawl   the governor of tortuga may call for a brawl as their action. if the governor is the only player on tortuga, he may still call for a brawl. only players on tortuga participate in the vote.   only the middle section of the vote card matters in a brawl and contains either a british flag or a french flag. if a majority of the revealed cards are british flags, place both pieces of treasure on tortuga in the british treasure area. if a majority are french flags, place both pieces of treasure on tortuga in the french treasure area. if there is a tie, place 1 piece of treasure in each area. the two pieces of treasure on tortuga always remain on tortuga, but they may be moved to either of the areas on tortuga in future brawls.mutiny    the first mate of a ship may call for a mutiny as their action. only players on that ship, except for the captain, participate in the vote.    only the bottom section of the vote card matters in a mutiny and contains either a skull or a helm. if a majority of the revealed cards have a skull, then the captain on the mutinying ship is marooned to tortuga. if a majority have a helm or there is a tie, nothing happens. two vote cards in the game have two symbols in each section. each symbol is counted towards the vote total.example: two vote cards are revealed in a brawl. one card has 1 british flag and the other special vote card has 2 french flags. the french team would win the brawl since it is 2 flags to 1.78getting marooned & tortugaif a pawn on a ship gets marooned to tortuga, pawns ranked behind it on the same ship will move up to fill in the empty pawn position. if the captain is marooned, the first mate becomes captain. if everyone on a ship has been marooned, the treasure that is on that ship remains on that ship in the same treasure holds. that treasure still counts towards a team’s total treasure unless it is moved later in the game. if a player boards an empty ship, they become captain of that ship.          if you are marooned to tortuga, your pawn is placed at the back of the line on tortuga. for example, if tortuga is currently empty then the “back of the line” is the governor’s position. for another example, if tortuga already has 2 pawns on it, the “back of the line” is the “3” position. while on tortuga you still get turns and you may still perform player actions as normal.          if you are already on tortuga and you get marooned again, two things happen to you. first, your pawn is moved to the back of the line on tortuga and pawns that were ranked behind you move up. (if you are alone on tortuga your position does not change). second, one of your vote cards is chosen at random by another player and placed unseen at the bottom of the vote card deck. you will play with fewer vote cards for the rest of the game. if you are marooned multiple times while on tortuga, you will lose multiple vote cards. if you lose all of your vote cards you may still call for a vote if in a position to do so but you will not be able to participate.rowboatsmoving to a rowboat takes one action. therefore, it takes two total actions to get from tortuga to a ship or from a ship to tortuga, since you must move to the rowboat as one action, and move to the ship or tortuga as the second action. if there is a pawn currently on a rowboat, no other pawn may move onto that rowboat since each rowboat holds only 1 pawn at a time. if your pawn is on a rowboat, you do not participate in votes. you are allowed to “sit” on the rowboat and perform other actions (e.g., viewing and revealing cards) in order to block other pawns. if you are marooned while on a rowboat, you must return your pawn to the back of the line on tortuga, but you do not lose a vote card.9ending & ","['Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting']"

you’re ready to play wavelength.psychic phaseeach round begins with the current team’s psychic spinning the wheel to randomize the target’s location, drawing a wavelength card, and giving a clue on the spectrum between the two concepts on the card. the psychic should do all of this secretly, so players on both teams can’t see where the target is.here’s the official order the psychic should go in (it’s a little over-detailed, but in practice it’s easy): 1. close the screen: rotate the screen using the plastic handle until it’s entirely closed and clicks into place.2. choose a wavelength: draw 1 wavelength card from the deck. they’re double sided, and the psychic can choose the side they want to use for their clue. on most cards there’s a “normal” side and a “weird” side. don’t think too hard about it: just pick the one you find most interesting! place the card in the slot in front of the device, with your chosen side facing forward, and read the card text so both teams can hear.3. randomize the target location: turn the wheel—using your fingers along the wavy edges—until you’re sure that the target is in a completely random position. the plastic screen should be closed while you spin: you can’t keep it open to select the target’s location.4. open the screen: using the plastic handle, open the screen and look at where the target is located. you should always open the screen completely, even if you can see the target with it partially open: otherwise, players watching you will be able to guess the general target location.very infrequently, the target’s center (the 4 point wedge) won’t be visible at all. if that happens, close the screen and spin again. if the center target is ever partially in view on the left or right extreme, that’s valid—even if it’s just a sliver.5. give a clue: look at where the target’s center is located spatially along the visible area of the wheel. now think of a clue that is conceptually where the target is located on the spectrum between the two concepts on your card. rules for how to give clues can be found later in this book. 6. close the screen: using the plastic handle, close the screen completely. now turn the box to face your team, so they can interact with the device.now the psychic stops communicating entirely! after the psychic has given their clue, they are no longer allowed to say anything—not even clarifications—and must keep an entirely straight face. if a psychic ever gives away the target location after giving their clue, either verbally or nonverbally, it’s up to everyone playing to decide whether to penalize the team. we tend to just let the psychic give a new clue with a new card and target location, but we’re generous that way.psychicphase team phaseafter the psychic gives their clue, it’s up to the rest of their team to reading their mind and turn the dial as close to the center of the target area as they can.this is the core of the game and it is almost entirely free of rules: teammates can discuss, debate, and argue in any way they like. after the psychic’s team has come to an agreement, they let the other team know that they’ve finalized their dial position.during this phase, just keep a couple things in mind:• don’t use percentages or numbers as shorthand for where to turn the dial. since wavelength is based off of gut feelings, you should restrict yourselves to saying things like “way more to the right,” or “down a little” rather than “turn it to 25%.” there’s no penalty associated with doing this—you should just avoid it in the spirit of the game.• everyone on the team has the right to turn the dial at any time. it’s up to the team to determine how to negotiate this.left/right phasein wavelength, both teams always have a chance to score points from a clue. after the psychic’s team has finalized their dial position, the other team gets to guess whether the center of the target  (the 4 point wedge) is to the left or right of the dial. this discussion should be fairly brief, since it’s a simple binary choice: left or right. the team makes their guess by placing the marker in either the left or right slot next to the wavelength card. for example, the image on this page shows the team guessing left, i.e. they think the psychic meant to convey something more hot than the current team guessed.hotcoldteamphase psychic teamscores the number of points printed on the wedge that the dial is in. below, the team scores 3 points.other teamscores by guessing if the center of the target is to the left or right of the dial. below, if the team had guessed left, they would score 1 point.scoring phaseonce both teams have finalized their guesses, it’s time for the most exciting part of the game: the reveal. the psychic opens the screen to reveal the target. their team scores points if the dial is within the colored target area, as listed on the colored wedges (2-4 points). if the dial is ever on an edge between two results, the psychic’s team always scores the better of the two results. the other team scores 1 point if they correctly guessed whether the target is to the left or right of the final dial position. if the psychic’s team guessed perfectly (the 4 point wedge), the other team cannot score.move each team’s scoring marker by those amounts.how the game progressespsychic phase: current team’s psychic gives clueteam phase: psychic’s team discusses and turns dial left/right phase: other team guesses left/rightscoring: psychic reveals target and points are givenalways a chance to catch up. if the psychic’s team scores 4 points, and is still losing to the other team after that round’s scoring, they immediately take another turn (with a different player as psychic).this means that a team down 9-0 could hypothetically take 3 turns in a row and win.after scoring, the other team begins their round unless the catch up rule is triggered, detailed in the next section.

the beginning of each round, each team selects a player to be their encryptor. this role rotates, moving from team member to team member. during each round, both encryptors will give clues for their codes, then both teams will try to guess both codes, starting with the white team’s code and followed by the black team’s code. each round is divided into the following steps. the order is very (very!) important:1. 2. 3. 4. each team’s encryptor draws one code card from their team’s deck and reads it quietly while keeping it hidden from all the other players. their goal is to get their teammates to say this code (for example: 3.4.2).using the note sheet, each team’s encryptor writes three clues on the three lines for the current round. write the clue for the first digit of the code on the top line, and so on. use the side of the note sheet that corresponds to your team’s color.to keep the game from dragging, try limiting the time as follows: as soon as either encryptor has finished writing their clues, they turn over the sand timer. the opposing encryptor must finish writing their clues before the sand timer runs out; otherwise, they won’t have three complete clues to give!the white team’s encryptor reads their three clues aloud, then hands the sheet to their teammates. the black team writes down the three clues on the white side of their sheet (in the current round’s section). both teams discuss the clues, trying to decipher the  code.  when  a  team  thinks  they  have  solved it,  they  write  the  number  they  think  corres-ponds to each clue at the end of each line (in the  first  of  the  two  columns  of  the  note  sheet). of  course,  the  encryptor  who  has  just  read  their clues does not participate in the discussion! they must not make any reaction to their teammates’ conversation.5. once both teams have written down their numbers, the  black  team  attempts  to  intercept:  they read  the  3-digit  code  that  they  wrote  down, hoping to match the white team encryptor’s code. important! during  the  first  round,  neither  team  tries  to intercept the other team’s code. in any case, they have no clues to help them intercept it.6. 7. • the white team now attempts to decipher the code: they read the 3-digit code they wrote down, hoping to match their encryptor’s code.finally, the white team’s encryptor reveals their code card.if the black team is correct (i.e., they wrote the  correct  numbers  in  the  correct  order),  they intercept the code and receive an interception token. they do not receive any penalty if their code does not match.• if  the  white  team  is  incorrect,  they misinterpreted  the  code  and  receive  a  miscommunication  token.  they  do  not  receive any reward if their code does match.therefore,  it  is  possible  that  one  team  receives  a miscommunication token (because they misinterpreted their  encryptor’s  clues),  while  the  opposing  team receives an interception token (because they successfully  intercepted their opponents’ code) in the same round.use the second column at the end of each clue on the note sheet to enter the correct code.at the bottom of your sheet, record the clues for this round in the section corresponding to their number. this way, you will be able to see the clues that relate to each number at a glance!7list of clues related to the fourth keyword repeat steps 3 through 7 by reversing the teams: the black team’s encryptor now reads their three clues aloud, players on both teams try to decipher the code, etc.end of the roundafter both teams have revealed their codes, the round ends. check to see if one of the teams has won or lost the game:- if a team has 2 interception tokens, they win the game.- if a team has 2 miscommunication tokens, they lose the game.if at least one of these two conditions is met, the game ends. otherwise, start a new round.put both code cards used this round back into their respective decks and shuffle. it is possible to draw the same code from one round to the next. then, choose a new encryptor for each team.tiebreaker-if a team has 2 interception tokens and 2 miscommunication tokens at the end of a round (winning and losing at the same time);-or, if both teams collect their second interception token in the same round;-or, if both teams collect their second miscommunication token in the same round;-or, if neither team has won or lost by the end of the eighth round;here is how to determine the winning team:count the points. an interception token is worth +1 point and a miscommunication token is worth -1 point. the team with the most points wins. if there is still a tie, each team tries to guess their opposing team’s four keywords. the team with the most correct answers prevails. in case of another tie, both teams share the victory!8example of playlet’s continue with the example from page 2 (“overview”). it’s time for the second round. alice will encrypt for the white team and eve for the black team. they each draw a code card and simultaneously write their clues on their note sheets.alice has drawn the code 3.4.2. she must convey these three digits, in that specific order, to bob.the white team’s keywords are still: 1black  2dragonfly  3cocktail  4sombreroshe knows that mallory and eve may attempt an inter-ception once she reads her clues out loud. they already have some information, since during the first round, bob came up with the clues “mexico”, “insect”, and “horror” for code 4 (sombrero), 2 (dragonfly), 1 (black). alice needs to confuse the other players.• • • to communicate the keyword number 3 to bob, she writes down the clue “evening with friends” on the first line.for the keyword number 4, she writes “parasol”, since sombreros are used to protect against the sun.for the keyword number 2, she writes “odonata”, the order of animals that dragonflies belong to.alice reads her clues aloud and passes the note sheet to bob. eve and mallory write down alice’s clues on the white side of their sheet. both teams use the white side because the clues were given by the white team’s encryptor.bob  understands  the  connection

against a  team  of  two  players.  each  round,  one  of  the  team players draws a code card and comes up with 3 clues, just like the regular game.to win, the interceptor must collect 2 interception tokens in 5 or fewer rounds.setupform a team of 2 players. this team, competing against the interceptor, takes a note sheet, screen, code deck, and 4 keyword cards that are placed in the screen, just like the regular game.the interceptor takes a note sheet.gameplaythe game plays according to the normal rules for steps 1 to 7, except for the allocation of tokens. if the interceptor successfully deciphers the team’s code, he receives an interception  token.  if  the  guessing  team  member  fails to  solve  their  encryptor’s  code,  they  do  not  receive  a miscommunication token; instead, give an interception token to the interceptor.like the regular game, the interceptor cannot attempt to intercept in the first round.also, since the interceptor plays alone, he can neither draw code cards nor guess his own codes.","['Communication Limits', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Targeted Clues', 'Team-Based Game']"

out the game board. the play area represents a blockbuster establishment. the board is the parking lot, then on top of it place the blue tube signpost, and on top of that the iconic blockbuster sign. 2. setup | split into two teams regardless of your number of players, you need to have two teams. split up the players and give yourselves a fun name (optional). 3. setup | put out cards & buzzer to play the game you will need the movie cards, head-to-head challenge cards and the buzzer. place these in the middle of the game area for all to access. 4. gameplay | quick fire round the opening of a round to determine advantage happens in a head-to-head challenge (think family feud style). one member from each team is up and gets ready to hit the game buzzer. a non-participating person flips over a “head to head” card and reads it. this will be something about movies that has lots of answers like “movies that take place on a boat”. a player buzzes in with an answer then their opponent has 30 seconds to buzz in with a new answer. this goes back and forth until a player can’t answer in time. 5. gameplay | winners choose movie cards now that there is a winner of the head-to-head challenge, the advantage is the winning team gets t choose the movie cards that go into the next round. all the cards fall into different genres, the idea is to collect them all, so this helps hedge the cards that are coming. the winners draw six movie cards, chooses three for them to take into their challenge and gives the remaining three to the other team. 6. gameplay | setup three mini challenges the round after the quick fire is about each team doing their own thing. there are three mini games a team will need to compete in and the three cards each team just got correlates with that. they are – (1) one word, (2) quote and (3) act it. the team players who competed in the head-to-head, now need to choose where to place each card so they can do this with their teammates. 7. gameplay | start timer one team goes at a time, the head-to-head challenge winners go first. hold down on the blockbuster timer to start a 30-second timer. once you let go you will have that period of time to do all three mini-games and hopefully get your fellow teammates to guess what you are trying to do. they are free to yell out answers whenever, there is no penalty for guessing wrong. 8. gameplay | game 1 | one word once the timer starts, the clue giver can say anyone one word in existence and based on that, teammates need to guess the film they are referring to. it doesn’t have to be from the move, though that probably helps, it just has to be enough info so your teammates can properly guess. once they name it, flip over the movie card and move to the next challenge.  9. gameplay | game 2 | quote it after you have completed one word or passed on it, you now do “quote it”. in this challenge, you must deliver a line of dialogue, word for word, to your teammate. they need to guess based on that. once they name it, flip over your move card and move to the next challenge. 10. gameplay | game 3 | perform it for the final challenge, you need to perform the movie on the card to get your teammates to guess. this is basically anything that doesn’t use words. be as animated or subtle as you need to be to get your team to guess. once they do, flip over you movie card. 11. gameplay | steal opponent cards if you get all three of your challenges correct and still have time left, you can try to steal from the opponents. choose one of their three challenges, that should have corresponding cards in them, and pick it up as if it is one of yours. if your team gets it right you get to keep it if not, it will go back to the other team who also gets the bonus of the clues you gave. 12. gameplay | collect winning cards the second team follows the first taking the same exact performance steps. the only difference is that if cards were stolen from them, they are out of luck. after both teams are done, they keep the cards they flipped over. all the cards can be from one of eight genres and the idea is to collect one from each. 13. gameplay | repeat rounds once everyone does their team performance rounds and collected their cards, if no one has won the game, rounds are repeated. a new member from each team is selected to compete in the head-to-head challenge which then leads into a team round. this continues until the game is over. 14. winning | collect a film in each genre there are eight different genres that one of the movie cards could fall into. once a team has successfully collected a film from each of the genres, they win the game.","['Acting', 'Team-Based Game']"

(if any wild cards are drawn in the next few steps, set them aside and draw again, we’ll get to wild cards in #7.)3.play piles: one at a time, players continue drawing cards from either pile, in clockwise order, until the symbols on two players’ cards match. if you draw a card and there is no match, the next player draws. note: you should only have one face-up card showing at a time. if it’s your turn and you already have a card in play, flip the new card on top of your existing card. this pile of cards is your play pile.

(see “face-off between players 3 & 4” in figure 1.) 5.cascades: the loser’s play pile may now reveal a new top card. watch out! a new face-off may now occur between the loser and any other player! drawing must not continue until all possible face-offs have been played. please note, play is structured so that there can be only one face-off at a time, though there may be many in quick succession. this is called a cascade.6.after a face-off/cascade: drawing continues with the next player in the clockwise drawing sequence. you may find it helpful to pass a small token around to indicate whose turn it is. a salt shaker or coin will do nicely.7.wild cards: a face-off can also be caused by a wild card. if you draw a wild card, place it face-up between the draw piles. a wild card displays two different symbols. if those two symbols are in play (i.e. if they appear on thetop of any two player’s play piles) then those two players must face-off.
